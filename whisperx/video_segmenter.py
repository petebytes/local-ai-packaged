Video Segmenter with VAD-based Chunking for WhisperX
Implements research-backed strategies for optimal long-form transcription

Based on 2025 best practices:
- VAD (Voice Activity Detection) for intelligent chunking
- 30-second chunks with 10-second overlap (12x speedup)
- Cut & Merge strategy for boundary handling
- Scene detection for natural break points
